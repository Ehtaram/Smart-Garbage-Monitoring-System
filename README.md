# Smart-Garbage-Monitoring-System

In this framework, dustbins are organized at level 1 of a building made under savvy city activity. It will gather the misfortune through keen pipe framework set in the building. The perceptive dustbins are interfaced with the web through GSM to get the present status. Two sensors are settled and no more lifted inspiration driving the dustbin to keep up a key Partition from wrong dimension estimation and are interfaced with the microcontroller.

To distinguish awful stench a gas sensor is set at the base of the dustbin and is adjacent to interfaced with the controller to remember it off the waste filled in the dustbin.
